# Getting Started with Simple NFT Creator

This project was created to learn more about the front end web3 space. Here you can easily mint your own NFT using GoerliETH to the contract and view your NFT on OpenSea.

This currently only mints to the contract I have provided. Additioal support to your own contract is in the works!
